The journey of becoming an Android developer started during my undergraduate program in 2018, as a mathematician. The quest to create problem-solving tools using mathematics laboratories and tools like programming is the main motivation for me as I learn more abstract concepts as a mathematician in the classroom. This is an empowering tool that will make it possible for me to implement the abstraction of mathematics to solve problems in the real world, and this has been my goal and philosophy at @aljebraschool. With Google's Africa Developer Training program's scholarship opportunity for Android developers, this quest began to take shape in 2022. I was exposed to rigorous and standard approaches for more than six months of training on how to build modern applications in Android OS. The basic concepts taught in this program gave me the skills and techniques I needed to make my dream of creating problem-solving tools as a mathematician a reality in the near future.

By teaching me fundamental concepts, the program equipped me with the skills and techniques required to actualize my goal of building problem-solving tools as a mathematician. During the program, I built over four utility applications as a prerequisite, each designed to solve problems that exist within our society. A few examples of the applications I have created include:

1\. Miwok Language Learning App: A language learning program developed using Android Studio. This app features multiscreen layout, list recycle view debugging, and memory management concepts.

2\. Earthquake App: One of my most advanced Android applications developed during my training as an Android developer. The app leverages the Application Programming Interface (API) concept to incorporate remote software into the app. I used this technique to script recent earthquakes from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website and update the app with the latest earthquake data from around the world. This app is one of my personal favorites.

3\. Coffee Ordering App: A small-scale business owner's scheduling app designed to take customer choices and requests. The main concept employed in this app is navigation between apps using 'Intent.' Customer requests can be sent to the shop owner via email.

All of the apps that have been mentioned are available as open-source projects and the code can be accessed on my Github repository at www.github.com/aljebraschool. Being part of this cohort and having the Google emblem on my certification list was a great opportunity.

It's important to remember that coding is a skill that can only be learned by doing, and certification simply signifies the completion of an activity. Let's not forget that "It's more important to know where you're going than to get there quickly, do not mistake activity with achievement".
