I am currently pursuing my graduate studies in “collective intelligence” at Muhammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), where I am enrolled in a course called “Computer Science Method in Collective Intelligence.” This course emphasizes the application of computer tools to implement group intelligence concepts, specifically addressing how technology can be leveraged to solve large-scale societal problems.

Given that the course mandates the development of tools to implement collective intelligence concepts, I opted to develop a language learning app that leverages the knowledge of the crowd to achieve this goal. My prior experience with Android development using Java was instrumental in this project. I received guidance and supervision from Mark Klein, an expert in collective intelligence and a research scientist at MIT, as well as a professor at UM6P.

As an Android developer with no expertise in Yoruba language scheme and content creation and lacking the skills to design visually appealing graphics, I sought out experts in these fields to help bring my language learning app to life. Olukunle Joseph Olayinka, a graduate of Yoruba education from Lagos State University, provided the app with well-structured content that he simplified for learners based on his experience in teaching the Yoruba language. Ali Opeyemi Bello, a computer education graduate of Adekunle Ajasin University who had previously worked with my brand online, designed the app icon and other necessary graphics to enhance its visual appeal. Their expertise in these areas was crucial to the success of the project.

Once my team was assembled, my initial objective was to conduct a market survey on existing Yoruba language learning apps on the Google Play Store. The survey revealed several major deficiencies in the available Yoruba language apps, including the use of non-native speakers or machines to pronounce Yoruba words and a lack of structured lessons to cater to learners with varying levels of language proficiency.

Given the limitations I discovered in existing Yoruba language learning apps on the Google Play Store, I resolved to create an improved alternative that caters to a wider age range of language learners and prioritizes accurate pronunciation. Yoruba is a tonal language, so it was crucial to create an app that emphasizes proper pronunciation.

Aside from the collaboration of the programmer, linguist, and graphics designer to create an improved Yoruba language learning app, the project also aims to tap into the collective intelligence of its users to address potential issues in the field. In order to achieve this, the app will request input from its users on how to enhance Yoruba language learning in future updates. By utilizing the wisdom of the crowd, the app will be able to continuously improve and provide a better learning experience for its users.

Considering that Android has the largest market share (71%) of smartphone operating systems, the development of this language learning app prioritized creating the best and most modern interface, easy-to-use navigation, and clear audio to cater to all users regardless of their level. The app is currently available for download on Google’s Play Store, and you can visit <mark>https://tinyurl.com/akomolede</mark> download and install it on your Android phone.

We value your feedback, and any comments or suggestions on how to improve the app will be taken into account for future updates.
